      The majority of visitors arrive in Taniti by air, although a small cruise ship also docks at Yellow Leaf Bay once a week for an overnight stay. The island is currently served by a modest airport, capable of accommodating small jets and propeller planes. Plans are underway to expand the airport, allowing larger jets to land on the island within the next few years, enhancing accessibility for future visitors.
